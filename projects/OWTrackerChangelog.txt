/!\ IMPORTANT /!\
KNOWN BUGS FOR ALL VERSIONS
   - If refresh is pressed many times in rapid succession, memory usage spikes drastically. DO NOT SPAM REFRESH, it can use hundreds of megabytes of RAM. I'm looking into this.

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
   - Competitive Points
     - The application can now track competitive points! Enter the number of points you currently have in the textbox next to your current rank and hit refresh

GENERAL UPDATES
   - The "last 12 hours" change in rank now automatically refreshes each minute
   - When adding a placement game, you are now asked for the result (win/loss/draw) for stats purposes

BUG FIXES
   - Fixed a bug causing the win rate graph to be backwards
   - "+0 last 12 hours" is no longer displayed when no games have been played in the last 12 hours
