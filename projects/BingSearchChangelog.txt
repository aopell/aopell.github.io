Make sure you install the Microsoft Rewards extension for Edge for extra points this month

Version 5.1:
+ Microsoft Rewards Dashboard now opens in Microsoft Edge for extra points
+ User agent string for desktop searches is now an Edge User Agent String
	- This *may* result in more points for using Edge, but it might not work

Version 5.0:
+ Updated for the new Microsoft Rewards. No functionality was changed, but things are worded differently.
	- Replaced "credits" with "points"
	- Multiplied points by 10 in all UI windows to match the change
	- Updated dashboard link to https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/dashboard
	- Replaced Bing branding with Microsoft branding
**IMPORTANT**
To earn points for searching with the new Microsoft Rewards, you *MUST* click the "Click Here to Log In to the Web Browser with your Microsoft Account" button and sign in again.

**YOU MUST** click the check box to "Keep Me Logged In" otherwise the browser will log you out each time you open the program.
